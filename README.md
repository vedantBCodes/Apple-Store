# Apple-Store
Here i am building an E-commerce website for apple products (Using Bootstrap).
Trying to build a responsive website using bootstrap.
It's my 1st responsive website and it was quite difficult for me to build it.
First built a non-responsive website and then add used  bootstrap 5.0 and some media queries to give responsiveness.
Also used some CSS along with Bootstrap to add styling .
